The a function is called twice with an argument of 6, first by b and then by c. The first call to a returns 42 and assigns it to prod in b. b then prints 6 42. The second call to a returns 42 again, which is squared by b and returned to c. c then returns 42**2, which is 1764. Therefore, the program prints 6 42 and returns 1764.
